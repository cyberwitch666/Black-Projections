# Black-Projections

The Black Projection Project theorizes that time as it functions now is part of a Western Time Project that works by limiting information about the past while also making the future feel out of our control. We seek to break that. By breaking this time function and exposing its connection to racist design systems, we conspire to project a new future, a black projection.

Materials for this project are for the Portal Mapping Device displayed at NYU ITP Winter Show 2019.
